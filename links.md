# Useful Links
These are links that are often visited by me. These links are related to operating systems and GitHub including scripting, Markdown, Linux tutorials, etc.

## 1. Markdown Guide
[Visit Here](https://www.markdownguide.org/)<br>

This website explains basic and advanced Markdown syntaxes clearly with examples. It also provides cheat sheets for easier use. This website also sells "The Markdown Guide" Book by Matt Cone for $5.

## 2. CryptoHack
[Visit Here](https://cryptohack.org/)<br>
CryptoHack is a platform where you can learn about cryptography. Not only it provides courses for almost each cryptography algorithms, it also provides challenges to users with different level starts from the introduction of cryptography, math, all the way to advanced and complex algorithms such as [Elliptic Curves](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elliptic_Curve_Digital_Signature_Algorithm "Elliptic Curve Digital Signature Algorithm (Wikipedia)") and [Hash Functions](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hash_function "Hash Function (Wikipedia)"). This platform helps you understand how each cryptography algorithm works, how to encrypt or decrypt them, their advantages, vulnerabilities, and how to exploit said vulnerabilities. Not to mention this platform is **completely free** and you can also record your progress and see your rank on the leaderboard if you made an account. This platform also has [blogs](https://blog.cryptohack.org/ "CryptoHack Blog") and [Discord server](https://discord.com/invite/h9E7cna5pV "CryptoHack's Discord Server") where you can share and receive news from other people's experiences in cryptography.

## 3. What Is a File System? Types of Computer File Systems and How they Work – Explained with Examples
[Visit Here](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/file-systems-architecture-explained/)<br>
The title really self explanatory. This is not a website, rather this is a post by Reza Lavarian from freeCodeCamp where he explains about filesystems in general. His explanation is included with pictures and examples so it is easier to understand. This post explains from what is a filesystem, the purpose of filesystem, how it works, all the way to maintaining data integrity. Oftentimes I reread this post as a reminder of filesystems works. Well, it's not really that detailed but it at least provide me the keywords for me to learn further.

## 4. RegExr: Learn, Build, & Test RegEx
[Visit Here](https://regexr.com/)<br>
RegExr is a platform created by Grant Skinner and the gskinner team where you can learn and test regular expressions or RegEx. This website provides you with detailed explanation of RegEx. It also has a feature where you can write your own RegEx and test them wheter the text you've written matches with your RegEx or not. This website also provides cheatsheet for easier use.

## 5. Vi/VIM documentation
[Visit Here](http://linuxfocus.org/~guido/vi/viref.html)<br>
This is a documention of Vi. The UI/UX may be not the best, but it has very detailed information about Vi. This websites can redirect you to the basics of VI, tips and tricks, and also VI original man page.

## 6. Pointers in C / C++ [Full Course]
[Visit Here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zuegQmMdy8M&ab_channel=freeCodeCamp.org)<br>
This is a Youtube video was created as a playlist made by the excellent instructors from MyCodeSchool Youtube channel, but compiled and reuploaded as one 4 hour length video by freecodecamp.org. This video explains in very detail about pointers in C/C++, which is one the most challenging topic to understand. Since this is a very detailed, slow paced video, I recommend you to not watch it in one sitting. You also have to watch and practice after each subtopic ends, so that you can remember the concept more. This video explains pointers in general, its purposse, pointer types, pointers as function arguments, pointers and arrays, function pointers, etc.
