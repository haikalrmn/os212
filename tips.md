# TIPS

## 1. What Should You Expect from This Subject
In Operating System, you are being pushed to study and explore on your own. Usually, the lecturer only explains the learning material very briefly and explains more about the assignments. So the detail of said material have to be explored on your own from Google, or "Google sana Google sini, gsgs". The assignment format is very strict. But on the other side, the assignments TO DOs are written very detailed. Even if you doesn't like Operating Systems, as long as you do the assignments and do well on weekly quizes, you should be fine.

## 2. Try All Demos and Previous MidTerm Problems
All of mentioned excercise are given by the lecturer and always explained and discussed in the synchronus session, although not all of them are explained due to class duration. Almost all of those excersice, or at least its modified version, are always show up as a question on quiz session. 
 
## 3. The Magical Way of Git
As I've already said from tips #1, the lecturer is very strict and could give a penalty (reduction) to your weekly score if you don't follow his/her instructions accordingly. This includes Git stuffs. Many problems encountered by my colleagues are invloving git and they got penalties because they did something that they didn't know was wrong. So, if you don't know Git and afraid to do something, here's a tip provided by my teaching assistants: 
* Do not change your root branch without the lecturer's approval
* Do not delete a branch
* Do not delete and recreate your repository
* Do not perform force push (git push -f)
* Do not perform git revert
* Do not perform git reset
* Do not fork/clone/rebase from one of your colleague's branch
* Do not modify provided scripts from the lecturer/teaching assistants that could made an error
