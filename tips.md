# TIPS

## 1. What Should You Expect from This Subject
In Operating System, you are being pushed to study and explore on your own. Usually, the lecturer only explains the learning material very briefly and explains more about the assignments. So the detail of said material have to be explored on your own from Google, or "Google sana Google sini, gsgs". The assignment format is very strict. But on the other side, the assignments TO DOs are written very detailed. Even if you doesn't like Operating Systems, as long as you do the assignments and do well on weekly quizes, you should be fine.

## 2. Try All Demos and Previous MidTerm Problems
All of mentionen excercise are given by the lecturer and always explained and discussed in the synchronus session, although not all of them due to class duration. Almost all of those excersice, or at least its modified version, are always show up as a question on quiz session.
