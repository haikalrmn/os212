# TIPS

## 1. What Should You Expect from This Subject
In Operating System, you are being pushed to study and explore on your own. Usually, the lecturer only explains the learning material very briefly and explains more about the assignments. So the detail of said material have to be explored on your own from Google, or "Google sana Google sini, gsgs". The assignment format is very strict. But on the other side, the assignments TO DOs are written very detailed. Even if you doesn't like Operating Systems, as long as you do the assignments and do well on weekly quizes, you should be fine.

## 2. Try All Demos and Previous MidTerm Problems
All of mentioned excercise are given by the lecturer and always explained and discussed in the synchronus session, although not all of them are explained due to class duration. Almost all of those excersice, or at least its modified version, are always show up as a question on quiz session. 
 
## 3. The Magical Way of Git
As I've already said from tips #1, the lecturer is very strict and could give a penalty (reduction) to your weekly score if you don't follow his/her instructions accordingly. This includes Git stuffs. Many problems encountered by my colleagues are invloving git and they got penalties because they did something that they didn't know was wrong. So, if you don't know Git and afraid to do something, here's a tip provided by my teaching assistants: 
* Do not change your root branch without the lecturer's approval
* Do not delete a branch
* Do not delete and recreate your repository
* Do not perform force push (git push -f)
* Do not perform git revert
* Do not perform git reset
* Do not fork/clone/rebase from one of your colleague's branch
* Do not modify provided scripts from the lecturer/teaching assistants that could made an error

## 4. Know Your Priorities
OS only claim 9 out of 11 of your weekly scores. If you have other priorities, you can always skip a week to do that instead. Just remember, you might miss that week's lessons by not attending class or not doing the assignment of that week. Do it if you only care about scores, or you might learn it yourself later on.

## 5. Always Back up Your Virtual Box Machines
Sometimes when you do something wrong, instead of debugging it and search for its solutions on the internet for like hours and hours without coming closer to a solution, you can always start from the beginning and redo the week instructions. Worst case scenario, if you done something that is irreversible, the only way you can fix it is to restore the virtual machine from the back up. So, before you made that mistake, it is advisable to make back up of your virtual machine each week after you've done the assignments so you can always revert to last week's state instead of reinstalling your virtual machine and start from zero.

## 6. Debugging Problems
Before you try to contact your lecturer, or teaching assistants regarding debugging problems, please make sure you try to **try to debug it yourself** and **search it up on Google** first. Before you ask your question, you have to do some effort to fix it first. That includes knowing what your problem is, where it goes wrong, what you have done before, and what you have done trying to fix it. By doing that shows the lecturer that **you are actively trying to solve your problem** and not just **being spoonfed by giving screenshots and follow your teaching assistants instructions without knowing anything**. And also don't forget to follow the lecturers order on how to communicate with them. By doing both attempt and communicate properly, first, you are a very great person in general, second, your questions have more chance being answered by the lecturer and/or teaching assistants. Being nice is common sense, you know.


This might be the last TIPS because this is the last week I'm doing this in OS (28 Nov). I might add some stuff later, or maybe not. Most probably no. Anyway, thank you for your time reading this. Hope these tips helps. To anyone doing Operating Systems in the future, good luck to you!
